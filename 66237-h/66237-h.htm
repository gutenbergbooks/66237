<p class="cap">“Guy, come and play with me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I can’t, Tina, I have no time;
I am going fishing soon with Urie Cass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said the little voice; “you
never get time, Guy, to have a game.”</p>

<p>“Cannot you have one game with her,
sonny!” said his mother; “the wee girlie is
dull playing by herself all day.”</p>

<p>“But mother, dear, I have no time now,”
and so saying, Guy shouldered his fishing
rod and walked off.</p>

<p>But his mother’s sad, grieved expression
seemed to haunt him all day, and his little
sister’s voice echoed so in his ears, that the
fishing was not altogether such an enjoyable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
time as he expected. He got back tired
and hungry, and soon after tea he was glad
to go to bed.</p>

<p>He was just dropping off to sleep, when his
eyes seemed to wander to the open window,
where the moonbeams were dancing in, as
if they had come to see what sort of a room
it was, and what the inmate was like. They
are inquisitive little things, you know; both
moonbeams and sunbeams. They like to
get into all the odd dark corners, and if
people are dirty and slovenly in their work,
they show up the dust, and dirt, as much as
to say: “Oh, fie, for shame, you slovenly
creatures!”</p>

<p>Just as Guy’s eyes alighted on the windows
<a href="#i_006fp">he saw two ladies come floating in on the
moonbeams</a>. “There he is,” one of them
whispered, “that is the little boy who has no
time. Let us carry him off to No-Time-Land.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_006fp">
  <img src="images/i_006fp.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_6">“<i>He saw two ladies come floating in on the moonbeams.</i>”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>Guy was fascinated at the beauty of his
visitors; so much so that he never thought
of hiding under the bed-clothes; but it would
have been little use if he had done so, for
these kind of ladies see everything, like the
fairies of fairyland. They lifted him up; it
was no use his struggling, for he seemed
quite powerless and unable to move a limb.
While they were carrying him, Guy noticed
they were very pretty. Gueldine, as her
companion called her, had golden hair and
large brown eyes, with golden brown lashes
and eyebrows, the other had chestnut brown
hair, and large blue eyes, with dark brown
lashes and eyebrows; her name was Crystal.</p>

<p>They ought to have changed eyes, he
thought: but perhaps they would not have
looked so nice? His eyes next went to their
dresses. Gueldine’s dress was pure white,
with a gold thread interwoven through it, and
a gold sash with long ends. It gave her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
a very dazzling appearance. On her hair
she wore a crescent moon of diamonds and
rubies. Crystal’s dress was white, with
silver interwoven, a silver sash with long
ends; in her hair were stars made of
diamonds and sapphires.</p>

<p>Away they went, over hills and water, then
he caught sight of dim grey hills in the
distance, as they drew nearer to them the
two ladies exclaimed—“Here we are in No-Time-Land.”</p>

<p>They floated across to the nearest town,
and placed him on a bench in the middle of
one of the parks, as it was getting daylight,
and said, “Good-by, little boy, we have no
time to stop,” and away they went. Guy
watched them till he could see them no
longer, and as it was fast getting daylight,
and things were becoming clearer every
minute, he roused himself, as he found now
he could move, and looked around. Dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
me! What a dreadful untidy-looking place;
and so it was, for papers were lying about
everywhere. In the centre of the square
was a fountain, but it was broken; the wall
round the basin was crumbling and falling
to pieces; the water seemed stagnant, the
flower beds, and grass lawns were overgrown
with weeds, and everything looked
sadly neglected and forlorn. A boy came
sauntering along, so Guy said to him—“Boy;
why does your park look so neglected
and untidy?” The boy stared at him.</p>

<p>“Are you a stranger?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Guy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other; “no one has time
here to put it right.”</p>

<p>“Are they so busy,” asked Guy.</p>

<p>“Too busy to answer your questions,” replied
the other, and walked off.</p>

<p>“No time either for manners,” shouted
Guy; but the boy was out of earshot, so did
not hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“I will go into the town,” he thought, “and
see what it is like,” so got up and strolled
about; but everywhere he went the same
neglect met his eyes. He became very hungry
after a while, and seeing a young woman
hurrying along, went up to her.</p>

<p>“Is there any place here where I can get
something to eat, please ma’am,” asked Guy.</p>

<p>“Oh! I have no time to talk to little
boys,” she said.</p>

<p>Again and again he asked the same question,
and received the same reply. He at
last saw a pastry cook’s shop, and went in.
People kept coming in and ordering things,
and, eating them, went out, saying, “I have
no time to pay, put it down.” A little girl
came in and asked for two penny buns.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pay for them?” asked
Guy.</p>

<p>“No one pays here,” she said, “we have no
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>How dreadfully dishonest, he thought.</p>

<p>“Please ma’am,” said Guy, “I am so hungry,
can you give me some bread and butter
and milk? but I have no money to pay for
it.”</p>

<p>She handed him a couple of rolls and
some butter on a plate, also a large tumbler
of hot milk.</p>

<p><a href="#i_011fp">“Never mind about money,” she said; “I
have no time to take it.</a> I will just put it
down,” and she immediately started to eat a
cake.</p>

  <div class="caption">
     <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_11">“<i>Never mind about money,” she said; “I have no time to take it.</i>”</a></p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Guy began to laugh, saying—“That’s a
funny way to put it down.”</p>

<p>“No time for anything else,” she replied.</p>

<p>Guy sighed. I am getting quite tired
hearing those words, he thought to himself,
“No time, no time,” always dinned into one’s
ears. As he had finished his meal he went
out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p>Seeing a number of children going to
school, he followed them in, and sat down
with them.</p>

<p>They all started as the schoolmaster came
in to sing—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We have no time to learn our lessons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No time! no time at all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We do not want to gain any sense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As we have no sense like Paul.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I suppose Paul is the schoolmaster,” said
Guy to the girl sitting next to him.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Guy,” he answered.</p>

<p>Then they all began to sing again—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a little boy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And he was called a guy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He wished to know Oom Paul;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But like the rest of us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had no sense at all.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Guy became very angry upon hearing this,
and began himself to sing—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You have no sense at all!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You need not tell me so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ve no time to talk to you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">So I’ll take my hat and go.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“School is dismissed,” said the schoolmaster,
“I have no time to-day to hear lessons.”</p>

<p>Guy went down a narrow lane, or passage,
it seemed, as it was carpeted; he saw
a little boy crying.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” said Guy.</p>

<p>“I have no time to tell you,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, rubbish,” said Guy; “make time.”</p>

<p>The boy looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why that is what they used to say to me
before I came down here. But I am not
clever, and I cannot make anything, not
even time.”</p>

<p>Guy was disgusted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“No;” he said, “stupids like you want a
good beating, and I would like to give you
one, only I think it would be a waste of time
to give you even that.”</p>

<p>“I did not know time had a waist,” said
the boy. “I thought it was only people.”</p>

<p>“You thickhead,” said Guy, and walked
off.</p>

<p>“What funny words he uses,” said the boy
“I wonder where he comes from? But, oh
dear; I have no time to think.”</p>

<p>Almost at the end of the passage Guy
came to a large eight-day clock; he stood
and gazed at it with surprise; and well he
might. For the clock was fixed upon a
long stick; in the centre of the clock the
eyes and lips moved as if it was alive. Outside
the face it had figures all round, in order
to tell the time of day. The arms and hands
protruded from the sides of the clock like
numerous arms and hands; which gave it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
rather an odd look. The pendulum hung
below, swinging backwards and forwards.
Just as Guy was looking at him, the clock
opened his mouth, rolled up his eyes, and
began to sing—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tick, tick, I’m a clock upon a stick;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Never on a shelf I’ll stay;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But in this no-time-land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a stick I’ll stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And my pendulum will wag all day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Dear me,” said Guy; “I’ve heard something
like that before; but it sounds all
wrong?”</p>

<p>“Everything is wrong in this land,” said
the clock.</p>

<p>“How is that?” asked Guy.</p>

<p>“No time,” said the clock.</p>

<p>“Did you ever study?” again asked Guy.</p>

<p>“Study?” questioned the clock, in a tone
of surprise. “I have heard of a person
being in a brown study, if that is what you
mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“No, no! Study the time,” said Guy. “If
you studied time you might manage to get
along better, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I get along alright,” said the clock;
“only if there is no time, how can you study
it?” He gave such a loud tick, and pulled
such a funny grimace that it frightened Guy,
so he began to run; and, as he turned the
corner, seeing no one was after him, he
stopped to take breath, and there right in
front of him was a large open piece of
ground, in the centre of which was a summer
house, and roads branching all ways
from it, and sign-posts saying where each
road led to.</p>

<p>Guy read some of the signs. One was to
the land Selfishness, another to Forgetfulness.
To the land of Put-off, and By-and-by.
Another was I Can’t and I Won’t.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! They are all as bad as the one
I am in, and I’ve no time to read any more.
Dear! Dear! I am always saying no time
myself now;” and, feeling very miserable,
he entered the arbour, sat down on one of
the cane chairs, and, putting his arms on the
table, rested his head on them.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful muddle things have got
into.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have stirred up the mud,”
said a voice.</p>

<p>Guy started! “The only sensible thing I
have heard yet,” he thought; and, looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
up, saw on the mantelpiece—he never noticed
a fireplace in the arbour before—a little old
man holding a scroll.</p>

<p>“May I ask your name, please sir?” said
Guy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Memory-Pricker,” replied the little
man; “but I am called M.P. for short.”</p>

<p>“Why, that stands for member of Parliament
too,” said Guy.</p>

<p>“Well, it is the same thing,” answered the
little man. “You see, ‘Parle’ in French
means to speak. So it is meant, that I,
an active member, speak to, and prick up,
people’s memories; it is what people would
call a play upon words; only you have a way
of putting it backwards.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, can you tell me why this is
called No-Time-Land; at least, how it got
its name?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I can,” said the M.P. “You
must have noticed people hurrying along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
bent on some great purpose, but they never
seem to attain that purpose; or to put it still
plainer, they want to do some great thing,
or even little things, but they never get time,
they say, to do them, so all their great and
little ideas end in simple talk. Consequently,
and in fact, all lazy people who say they
have no time, are sent to No-Time-Land.”</p>

<p>“Do they ever leave here? Mr. M.P.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” said the little man, “when
they stray into my arbour, I prick up their
memories; they occasionally turn over a new
leaf then, if they wish to overcome their
bad habits; but it is not often,” sighed he,
“not often!”</p>

<p>“May I ask what you use the scroll for,
please sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes; this is my scrap book. I am a
collector of poetry, wise sayings, and various
other things of interest. Here is a piece—you
may like to read.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Guy got up and went close to the scroll,
and read these lines—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No time like the present</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To do the things that are right;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you let your chances slip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They may vanish from your sight.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then do the thing that’s right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Find time to help another;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let love be the golden rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No time lost in endeavour.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“I like that,” said Guy. “I think I will
have a try, too.”</p>

<p>“Small beginnings may lead to great endings,”
said the Memory Pricker.</p>

<p>Ting, ting, went a bell. A great noise
arose. Guy hurried out to see what it was
all about. People were hurrying along,
shouting “Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!”</p>

<p>“Kill who?” cried Guy, running up to a
small boy.</p>

<p>“Time, of course;” said the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“But why kill him,” cried Guy. “What
has he done?”</p>

<p>“You simpleton,” said the other, “have
you never heard of ‘People killing time’ or
‘Murdering the time’?”</p>

<p>“Yes I have,” remarked Guy; “but instead
of ‘Killing’ him, suppose you try and ‘Keep’
time my boy?” so saying, Guy stuck out his
leg and tripped him up. Guy heard Mr. Time
laugh and shout out—</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tick, tick, said the clock upon a stick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pride will have a fall,” they say.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But Guy heard no more, for he had to
run, as the little boy was chasing him. He
ran and ran till he was nearly out of breath,
and thought the boy would soon catch him,
as he was gaining on him fast.</p>

<p>When he heard someone shaking him,
and saying, “Guy, dear! Guy, wake up! the
breakfast bell has rung, and you will be late
for school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! Mother,” said Guy, “can it all be
only a dream?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sonny; you have been very fast
asleep; but hurry, now, and you can tell me
your dream as soon as you are dressed.”</p>

<p>While he was eating his breakfast, he told
his mother his dream.</p>

<p>“Was it not a strange dream, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearie; but strange dreams are often
sent us for some wise purpose, if we have
only the wisdom to understand the meaning
of them.”</p>

<p>“You mean, Mother, it was sent to break
me of my fault of always saying ‘I have no
time.’”</p>

<p>His mother smiled, and said “Just that,
sonny!”</p>

<p>In after years, Guy used to say that dream
of his was at the bottom of all his success
in life, as he mastered a bad fault, and at last
quite gave up saying “I have no time,” but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
always “found time” for everything, not
only in doing his own work, but also in
helping others, so that his life became a truly
happy and useful one.</p>

<p>And now, dear little readers, will you also
try and overcome your faults? Not in your
own strength, for then you will surely fail;
but in the strength of Him, who said “Be
ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is
perfect.” Then you, too, can claim the promise,
which is this:—“He that overcometh
shall inherit all things, and I will be his God,
and he shall be my son.”—Rev. xxi. 7.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
